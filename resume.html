            I wrote routing optimization algorithm when I was graduate and undergraduate. However, I got the charm of coding until I knew web development, furthermore, the front-end part. 
            Implementing functional features, creating interactions, I love the procedure of making project 
            work. I appreciate all products that benefit and expand our daily life, and I hope I can apply my 
            skill and acknowledge to these amazing products.
